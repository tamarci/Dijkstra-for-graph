# Dijkstra-for-graph
Dijsktra algorithm to plan route from a point to an other

##Input format:

Number of routes r (int)
Number of vertices v (int)
Number of edges e (int)

r lines with two integers tabulated: A \t B
A: starting point
B: destination

r lines with two integers tabulated: x \t y
x: x coordinate of vertice
y: y coordinate of vertice

r lines with two integers tabulated: v1 \t v2
v1,v2: two vertices that have edge together
